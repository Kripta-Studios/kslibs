# kslibs (Kripta-Studios library system)

### What is kslibs?

The **"Kripta-Studios library system"** is a program that will **manage the libraries** in C and C++ projects in Windows 10.

Is an **open-source project** under the **GPLv3 license** that aims _**to solve the problem**_ _faced by many developers who have great difficulty for downloading, linking and use different C and C++ libaries or frameworks_. **kslibs** aims to fix this by creating a CLI (command line interface) application that downloads, link and compile a program without the interact of different large commands **to link the object files, the libraries** and all that stuff. This program will make _easier the use of libraries and frameworks in Windosws 10_ as is in other languages such as **Python3** with **pip3**.

### Install 
You have to type exaclty this in a command line:
```
make && make tools/ -o .silentCMD && ./kslibs
```

### The 3 main parts of "kslibs" project

* **1.** Create an **extensive database** with the **most used libraries and frameworks** in C and C++. And a **JSON file** to access the location of **each library automatically**.

* **2.** Create the program that **manage the project, detecting files, libraries** and other important information for the user project.

* **3.** Create the final program that has everything mentioned before and also **a complete relationship** with the compiler **GCC** for automate the process of **linking and compiling**.

### Planification

This entire project in this **month of October 2020** is still in the **first phase** of any project, the most complex phase, in which **we think about how to do all** of this in the most **efficient and fast way possible**. The development of the **kslibs** project is expected to begin in 2021. It is expected to end at the end of 2022. But the time will always depend on the support of the community and the help of other developers, it is an **open-source project** all developers who want to collaborate with ideas, help or directly writing code are all **welcome**.

In principle, the project is expected to be written **mainly in C and C++**. And for **Windows 10 systems**, although obviously it will try to create compilations for most Linux distributions. If the **community considers** the use of another programming language very necessary, **it will be considered** whether to use a language other than C and C++.

### Thanks to:
The creator of the Rang mini-lib and to Uli KÃ¶hler for the creation of a simple donwloader class, both libs are **public domain**.
